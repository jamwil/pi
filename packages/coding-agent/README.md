**Note**: This is a personal fork of [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono) at [jamwil/pi](https://github.com/jamwil/pi), rebased onto upstream regularly. It differs as follows:

- All telemetry and non-provider network calls (update checks, model catalog refresh) are disabled unconditionally.
- The `/share` and `/bug` commands are removed; sessions are not uploaded anywhere.
- The CLI is published as [`@jamwil/pi-coding-agent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jamwil/pi-coding-agent); see PUBLISH_FORK.md in the repository root for versioning and the release process.
- The npm package includes a standalone Node build (`dist/standalone/cli.mjs`) that runs without `node_modules`.

The rest of this README is inherited from upstream.

# Pi

Pi is a minimal, extensible agent harness that you can make your own.

Adapt Pi to your workflows, not the other way around. Customize Pi with [extensions](docs/extensions.md), [skills](docs/skills.md), [prompt templates](docs/prompt-templates.md), and [themes](docs/themes.md). Bundle them as [Pi packages](docs/packages.md) and share via npm or git.

Pi ships with powerful defaults but skips features like sub-agents and plan mode. Ask Pi to build what you want, or install a package that does it your way.

Use Pi [interactively](docs/usage.md), automate it in [print or JSON mode](docs/cli.md), control it over [RPC](docs/rpc.md), or build apps with the [Pi TypeScript SDK](docs/sdk.md). See [OpenClaw](https://github.com/OpenClaw/OpenClaw) for a real-world integration.

## Getting started

Install the command-line interface:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pi.dev/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows:

```shell
powershell -c "irm https://pi.dev/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The installer pins all dependencies and updates Pi with `pi update`. Alternatively, install directly with npm, which does not pin transitive dependencies:

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

Pi requires Node.js 22.19 or newer. The macOS, Linux, and Windows installers can install it if needed. Pi does not require dependency lifecycle scripts for a normal npm installation.

Start Pi in the directory where you want it to work:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
pi
```

For a built-in AI provider, run `/login` inside Pi to connect a subscription or API key. Then give Pi a task.

See the [documentation](docs/index.md) for full setup and usage instructions.

## Development

Clone the repository, install its dependencies, and run Pi from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/earendil-works/pi
cd pi
npm install --ignore-scripts
./pi-test.sh
```

`pi-test.sh` can be called from any directory and preserves the caller's working directory.

Before submitting changes, run:

```bash
npm run check
./test.sh
```
